### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh

# Run specific test categories
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh --advanced-only
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh --performance-only
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh --error-only

# Run with parallel execution
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh -j 4

# Run with verbose output
./run_gaudi_tests_enhanced.sh -v
```

### Manual Test Execution
```bash
