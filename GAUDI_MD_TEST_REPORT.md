# UCX Gaudi Memory Domain Test Report

## Test Summary
- **Test Date**: June 26, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ PASS
- **UCX Version**: 1.16.0
- **Tested Functions**: `uct_gaudi_md_open` and `uct_md_close`

## Environment Information
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- **Kernel Modules**: Habana Labs module loaded successfully
- **Hardware**: 8 Gaudi devices detected
- **Libraries**: 
  - `/workspace/ucx/modules/libuct_gaudi.so` (UCX Gaudi module)
  - `/usr/lib/habanalabs/libhl-thunk.so` (Hardware thunk library)

## Test Results

### System Prerequisites
- ✅ Habana Labs kernel modules loaded
- ✅ 8 Gaudi devices found via PCI
- ✅ Gaudi UCX module built successfully
- ✅ hlthunk library available

### Module Loading Tests
- ✅ Successfully loaded UCX Gaudi module via dlopen
- ✅ Successfully resolved `uct_gaudi_md_open` function
- ✅ Successfully resolved `uct_md_close` function

### Functional Tests
- ✅ Successfully called `uct_gaudi_md_open(NULL, "gaudi", NULL, &md)`
- ✅ Memory domain handle returned (non-NULL)
- ✅ Successfully called `uct_md_close(md)`

## Test Details

The test verified the basic functionality of the UCX Gaudi memory domain by:

1. Confirming that the necessary system resources are present (kernel modules and hardware)
2. Verifying that the UCX Gaudi module was built correctly
3. Testing the successful opening of a Gaudi memory domain
4. Ensuring the memory domain can be properly closed

The test was minimal by design, focusing only on the functionality of `uct_gaudi_md_open` and `uct_md_close`. No memory operations (allocation, registration, etc.) were tested as these are not implemented in the current version of the module.

## Recommendations

The Gaudi module has been successfully verified for basic functionality. For complete verification of the memory domain functionality, future tests should include:

1. Memory allocation and deallocation tests
2. Memory registration and deregistration tests
3. RDMA operations with Gaudi memory
4. Performance benchmarks for memory operations
