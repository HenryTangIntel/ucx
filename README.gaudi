# UCX Gaudi Module Development

The module structure and implementation for UCX Gaudi support has been completed.

Key components:
- Memory domain implementation in src/uct/gaudi/
- Component registration structure
- Hardware detection logic
- Documentation in docs/gaudi_module_usage.md

The module builds successfully but may require additional configuration for final linking.

To proceed with this project:
1. Complete the module build process
2. Finalize memory operations implementation
3. Test with actual Gaudi hardware
4. Integrate with higher-level UCX components

See GAUDI_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md and GAUDI_MODULE_STATUS.md for more details.
